-Phone Recording, 2-5 min long

1-Tie back to job you're applying for

2-Tell a story

A:

Hi, I'm William Z Chadwick.

What should I say about myself?

Well, for a long time, I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I've been interested in a lot of different things. So in a sense what I have to say is the story of figuring out how to tie together these different things.

Past
Present
Future

3-Talk about the past: In college, I studied English literature, worked as a tutor in philosophy, literature and Graphic Design, and I actually wrote a book of poems which I hope to publish someday. During two of my college summers I worked on a ropes course for people with special needs and the third summer I was a Team Leader at another summer camp. Since college, I taught myself German and worked primarily as a caregiver for the elderly, but I didn't know what I wanted to do; I love beauty and ethics and having deep conversations with others, but I felt like no one field or job would touch on all my different needs.

4-Talk about the Present: After last year was one of the hardest years of my life, I have been doing a lot to make this year one of the best years for me and my family. I have a beautiful wife and three smart, wonderful kids. After I realized I could learn German, I decided to start learning more and more coding. I've made new friends and really broken new ground in my personal life and my mental health. I started a blog which is important to me. I have taken so many steps to improve life for myself and my family I can't even list them all here.

5-Talk about future, long term goals: I don't have an exact plan for the future, but knowing me it is going to involve a number of things tied together; I'll sum it up like this: My goal in life is to use my love of language, careful thinking, ethics, beauty and people to think through real problems of technology with those around me.

6-What brought you to coding/tech/bootcamp -- accomplishments?

Hi, I'm Will Z Chadwick.

What should I say about myself?

Maybe the first thing I should say is that I care, and I care a lot about many different people and things.

After that, I should add that for a long time I didn't know what I wanted to do. In a sense the task that I've had is to learn how to tie together these different things I care about.

B.

So, to begin with, here are some things about me that will tell you what kind of person I am: in college, I studied English literature while tutoring students in philosophy, literature and Graphic Design, and I actually wrote a book of poems which I hope to publish someday. During two of my college summers I worked on what was, at the time, the only wheel-chair accessible ropes course in America at Camp Barnabas, a summer camp for people with special needs. The third summer I was the Team Leader at another summer camp where I designed procedures for a zipline and rockwall and trained my team on how to safely facillitate these. Since college, I taught myself German and worked primarily as a caregiver for the elderly, but I still didn't know what I wanted to do long-term; I love beauty and ethics and having deep conversations with others, but I felt like no single field or job would touch on all my different real needs. I didn't know how to complete my task of tying everything together.

C.

Coming closer to the present, 2021 was one of the hardest years of my life, for a number of reasons. Increasingly since August of 2021, I have been doing a lot to step up and make 2022 one of the best years for me and my family. I mean, I have a beautiful wife and three smart, wonderful kids, and I want to give them the best that I can. I've really broken new ground in my personal life and my mental health. After I realized I could learn German through doing a little every day and being very resourceful, I decided to start learning more and more computer coding skills. The more I learned about coding, the more I realized that I could tie together the different things I care the most about through this experience of coding. I started a blog where I write about intersections of tech, ethics, spirituality and language. And I want to start pulling in design work as well. I have taken so many steps to improve life for myself and my family from August to August that I can't even list them all right now. But I feel like things are really coming together for me.

D.

To illustrate the sort of things I've been doing so far regarding learning how to code; first let me say that I started [Pro-min-ay-oh] Tech's Front End Bootcamp through Arapahoe Community College in July 2022, and am now in Week 4 out of 18 weeks. Before that, I had gathered over 20 different (mostly) free resources for learning how to code, and had spent a good amount of time working on most of them. On Udemy, for instance, I have completed 100% of their Git and Github Bootcamp course, 70% of their Bash Mastery course, 33% of their Beginning C++ Programming course, and have others lined up. I have also completed or made good progress through various courses and certificates on apps like Mimo, Grasshopper, Enki Coding, SoloLearn, Programming Hub, Programming Hero, Zenva, The Great Courses: How to Program, Khan Academy, and Harvard's CS50 course. Lastly, I am about 42% of the way through The Odin Project's very thorough Foundations Course.
